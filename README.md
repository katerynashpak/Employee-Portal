# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- This web app allows for collaborating on small-scale projects
- Working on this project gave me a better understanding of how to create dynamic web elements

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
1. download node.js
2. open terminal in the project folder
3. terminal input:
    - "npm install --express"
    - "node -v"
    - "npm init"
    - "npm i --save-dev dotenv nodemon" 
    (nodemon allows to restart server after making changes automatically)
    (dotenv allows to have variable to store in .env to load in the server)
    - "npm install dotenv --save"
    - "npm i express mongoose"
    - "npm start devStart" (to start application; the devStart name is defined in package.json)
    - "npm i express ejs" (ejs is a template used to write html using node js)
    (ejs is more server side and React.js jsx is more client side)
    - "npm i bcrypt" (to hash passwords & compare hash passwords to ensure that they are secure)
    - "npm i passport-local express-session express-flash" 
    - "npm i method-override" (for logout)"
    - "npm install express mongoose nodemailer crypto bcryptjs"

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
